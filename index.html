        <br /><br />
        <p>
          I am Humberto, Portuguese, grew up in France, born in 1991. I studied
          a bachelor&apos;s degree in management (AES companies management), and
          a master&apos;s degree in Finance at Aix-Marseille II University.
          During the master&apos;s degree, I did a curricular internship for six
          months, in Provence Création d&apos;entreprises. My role was to advise
          companies on investment strategies.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          During three years, I had a financial consulting company in Portugal.
          I have advised companies on investment strategies, auditing, cost
          reduction, increase in profitability, increase in profit, taxation. I
          have worked with several companies from different sectors, clothing,
          food, distribution, energy, finance, chemicals, transport, industry.
          Mostly companies are located in the United States of America, but also
          in Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Germany, United Kingdom.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My ambition has always been to work in financial investments, so I
          decided to focus my work on financial investments to the detriment of
          business consulting, for two reasons: <br><br>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li>
              First of all, I believe that financial investments are more
              stimulating. <br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
              Then being able to work mostly for individuals and help them in
              their financial management correspond more to my values.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Currently, I am living in Espoo, Finland. My company "Pontes
          Investments" is based here. I can work with people all over the world,
          my work has no borders. I chose to move to Finland because I identify
          with Nordic culture.

              invest are very stable, I never invest in speculative investments.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Before investing, I study all components of companies where I
              think to invest to minimize the risks. After that, I submit the
              file to the insurance which must approve it.

              interest rate, 1,6% on average.
