            My work is to help you to manage your monthly budget, analyzing with
            you what are your incomes and your monthly expenses. Beyond this,
            improving your incomes inside the possible, as well as lower your
            expenses.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I will find the best possible credit (house, car, house renovation,
            etc.) and will negotiate with several banks to find the best deal
            for you.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I manage your wealth management (financial or real estate),
            analyzing with you the different options, determining what are the
            objectives, and working to achieve those objectives.

            My work is to invest your money, the investment will bring you a net
            profit of 10% per year. It is flexible for you because you can get
            your money anytime. However, if your money is invested less than one
            year, you do not receive the benefits.
