          <h1>Wealth Management</h1>

          <p>
            I can help you manage your wealth, money, or assets. I will show you
            different options for management, depending on your profile and
            goals, and together we will choose what is the best option for you.
            Usually, there are two options for wealth management: the one with
            no risk and less profit, or the one with existing risk but more
            profit. In sum, the risk-reward ratio is proportional: if there is
            less risk, the return is lower, and vice-versa.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I can also support you in managing your monthly budget. In this
            case, we will together analyze your income and expenses. We will
            discuss about your monetary and personal goals and how to achieve
            them with lower costs, according to your own needs, towards a
            peaceful end of the month.

          <p>
            If you decide to invest with me, my work is to invest your money.
            The investment will bring you a net profit of 10 percent a year.
            This financial investment is flexible, because you have the
            possibility to withdraw your investment at any time, without paying
            penalties. However, to collect the interest your investment
            generated, it must be maintained for a minimum of one year. After
            that, you have the option of withdrawing or leaving your profits
            within the financial investment, to generate more profits.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            When I invest your money for you, it is placed in strategic
            companies and projects, with good economic prospects. It is a
            personal choice of mine not to invest your money in the stock
            market, because these investments offer more risks. As a
            professional, I prefer to promise my clients less profit and ensure
            absence of risks. All investments and related profits entrusted with
            me are protected by insurance.

          <p>This service is intended for companies.</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Here, I give you advice to improve your company’s profits and lower
            your operating costs, help you define an investment strategy, advise
            in financial audits and conduct market studies. These options are
            independent of each other. You can choose to purchase one or more of
            them. The central idea is to offer a personalized service adapted to
            each situation, taking into account the specificity of the company,
            the sector of activity, the micro and macroeconomic situation, as
            well as local demand.

            I promise not to invest your money in companies that employ minors
            under the age of 14, using resources from an armed conflict, do not
            respect Human Rights, women's rights, finance criminal organizations
            or not fully transparent.

            and good resource management.
